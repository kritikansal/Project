introducing speeched
  -android based application for analysis of audio waveforms.
  -allows you to :
    -generate waveforms from a variety of audio formats : wav, riff, mp3 and more
	-zoom into/out of waveform for detailed analysis
	-play select sections, waveform displayed dynamically
	-annotate regions of interest
	-store subsections of audio file
	-and much more!

why go mobile?
  -accessibility
  -reach
  -android!

why should you care
  -speech analysis
  -even tuning your guitar or learning a new language! : maintain an audio diary
  documenting each language lesson. Analyse how close you're getting to the optimal/
  target waveform. (are you listening, sharad gupta and co?)

design principles
  -iterative incremental model
  -android is terrible at MVC. android's API philosophy is template/inheritance
  over composition; which makes it bad for testing too. That being said, there
  are ways to get MVC out of android, but it is not intuitive.
  -5 major components, specified in design doc.
  -minimal, intutive ui, complying with the android ui design guidelines.

ENOUGH WITH THE TALK ALREADY! *cue for product demo*

testing
  -comprehensive unit testing
  -acceptance testing (refer updated testplan)
  -robotium, alpha testing

known bugs
  -player unresponsive to dynamic change in marker positions

watch out for
  -updated mediaplayer controls
  -taggin system
  -precaching to improve loading times
  -arbitrary zooming, pinch to zoom.
