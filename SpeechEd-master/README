  Android based application for analysis of audio waveforms.

Build instructions:

You will need Apache Ant installed.

Download the Android SDK and install it following the instructions given here at developer.android.com
Download the emulator if you haven't following the instructions given here at developer.android.com

Run the emulator.

Then in terminal, go to the directory Speech-Ed and run:

chmod u+x install.sh
./install.sh

Introducing speeched
  -android based application for analysis of audio waveforms.
  -allows you to :
    -generate waveforms from a variety of audio formats : wav, riff, mp3 and more
-zoom into/out of waveform for detailed analysis
-play select sections, waveform displayed dynamically
-annotate regions of interest
-store subsections of audio file
-and much more!

why go mobile?
  -accessibility
  -reach
  -android!

why should you care
  -speech analysis
  -even tuning your guitar or learning a new language! : maintain an audio diary
  documenting each language lesson. Analyse how close you're getting to the optimal/
  target waveform. (are you listening, sharad gupta and co?)

design principles
  -iterative incremental model
  -android is terrible at MVC. android's API philosophy is template/inheritance
  over composition; which makes it bad for testing too. That being said, there
  are ways to get MVC out of android, but it is not intuitive.
  -5 major components, specified in design doc.
  -minimal, intutive ui, complying with the android ui design guidelines.

ENOUGH WITH THE TALK ALREADY!

testing
  -comprehensive unit testing
  -acceptance testing (refer updated testplan)
  -robotium, alpha testing

known bugs
  -player unresponsive to dynamic change in marker positions

watch out for
  -updated mediaplayer controls
  -taggin system
  -precaching to improve loading times
  -arbitrary zooming, pinch to zoom.
